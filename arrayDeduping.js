// Question #2: Array Deduping

// Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.
// Example

// Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi" 7, 53]

// Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]
