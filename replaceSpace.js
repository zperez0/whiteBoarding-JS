// Question #1: Turning Strings to URLs

// URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

// You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.
// Example

// Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"

// Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"
