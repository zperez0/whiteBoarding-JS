Question #2: Array Deduping
Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.
Example
Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi" 7, 53]
Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]

- Empty array
- For loop -> search duplicates
- Remove duplicates and push them into the new array
- indexOf -> searches the array, if returns -1 it will be pushed to newArray

arrayDedupling = (input) => { 
  let newArray = [];
  for(let i=0; i < input.length; i++) {
    if(newArray.indexOf(input[i]) === -1) {
      newArray.push(input[i]);
    }
  }
  return newArray;
});
